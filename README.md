# Shos.MCPSample

This solution provides a sample implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and client using C# and .NET 9.

## Overview

Shos.MCPSample demonstrates basic communication between an MCP server and client. It is intended as a reference for learning how to use MCP in distributed systems or network applications.

### Projects

- **MCPServer.Console**: Console application implementing an MCP server.
- **MCPClient.Console**: Console application implementing an MCP client.
- **MCPServerLab**: Experimental project for testing and validating server features.

Each project contains sample code for message exchange and connection management using the MCP protocol, serving as a starting point for understanding and applying MCP in your own applications.
